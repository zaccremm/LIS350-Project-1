				<h2>How Volvelles are Created</h2>


				<p> Volvelles were most commonly created using junk pieces of paper, meaning printed sheets from other projects that had errors printed on them. An example of this is in the University of Wisconsin Madison Special Collections: in their edition of 
                    “Cosmographia” by Peter Apian, the back of all of the little moving pieces of the astrolabe show that the pieces were cut 
                    out of pages with mistakes on them, being used for these models rather than throwing them away. The images in the models were 
                    then printed on these pieces of paper using wood block or intaglio printing, then cut out to create the desired shapes <a href="./sources.html" style="color:brown; font-size:10px; ">[15]</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once all of these shapes had been created and separated, the printer or binder would fasten them together using a needle and thread, 
                    poking through an existing page and tightly securing them to the paper <a href="./sources.html" style="color:brown; font-size:10px; ">[1]</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to these brittle methods of creation, volvelles are notoriously fragile, and most are secured in display cases or in special 
                    collections and unavailable to touch as to preserve them <a href="./sources.html" style="color:brown; font-size:10px; ">[2]</a>.
                </p>
